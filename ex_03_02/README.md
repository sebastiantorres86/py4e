Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program. The following shows two executions of the program:

```bash
Enter Hours: 20
Enter Rate: nine
Error, please enter numeric input
```

```bash
Enter Hours: forty
Error, please enter numeric input
```
